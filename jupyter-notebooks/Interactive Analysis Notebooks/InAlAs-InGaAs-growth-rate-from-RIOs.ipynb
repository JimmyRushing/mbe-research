From Yerino2017 (DOI:10.1116/1.4972049), we know that we want to acheive a growth rate of .16ML/s (monolayers per second) in order to achieve high quality material growth. \n","\n","We will use the data from RIO's to achieve this composition and this rate. Stored on google drive should be the RIOs data. This data is collected by growing the materials of interest(red arrows) and monitoring the rate of the growth with the RHEED. Because we know that an oscilattion of the RHEED pattern corresponds to a new monolayer being deposited, we can directly observe the rate of material growth in ML/s. The details of this process can be found the the RIOs SOP on google drive. \n","\n","Displayed below is a Zinc Blende crystal structure. This is the structure of III-V semiconductors. You can image the blue atoms to be Gallium and the tan atoms as Arsenic for example. If we imagine growing these crystals from the bottom up, the first image is of [100] crystal growth and the second is in the [111]. The spacing between monolayers of our material can be written in terms of the lattice consant, \"a\", as shown below.
