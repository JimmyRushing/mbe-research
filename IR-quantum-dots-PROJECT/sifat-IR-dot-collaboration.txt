Challanges: they are grown on 111
how we etch mazer for confinement will be vastly different on 111
we grew some test LED structures 
sifat started by making ohmic contacts 
shokey contact is ok but ohmic contanct is better
Start the process at harvard clean rooom
p-type contacts are easy but research is still ongoing for n-type
why not put a thin layer of InAs just below where your ntype contact
yea could could get near metallic ctransport 
the project could be grown GaSb 111 telluriem doped. put some inas on top. 
literature sourch for 111 device structure
need to do: can we etch gasb 111
look at in on SEM. 
thinking about n-type contacts for GaSb
final part: use next nano to simulate the strucure for the device
investigat the crystat potential:
