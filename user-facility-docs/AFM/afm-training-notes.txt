need one more training to be fully certified

standard tip holder may be shipped off for mainteneance soon (2 weeks down time) can use a different mount that has strong magnet. 

go into standard AC air mode topography 


orca is conductive afm. 

always safe to hit focus on tip. not always safe to focus on sample because you can crash

you can right clcik and hit spot on to move stage

then get focused on the tip

generally want the sum to be as close to 9 as possible 

want delflection to be 0. to achieve that just hit "zero pd"

auto decimate possibly needed. the sum will very by tip coatings reflection.

hold shift and hit the top left arrows to move laser

once the focus is correct on tip and and sample then its safe to move to pre engage whcih brongs the tip to 50 microns

had to toy with exposure and zoom (bottom left) 

    gotta hit SET**

    just need to get the free air resonance from the auto tune. just set the range to meet the specs of the probe we choose

    higher gain (up to 30 or 40) helps protect the new tip *in imaging mode tab to the left*

    starrt at 5 micron and 1 Hz

    phase should be below 90 ideally
