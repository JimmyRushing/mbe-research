InAs with GaSb into it. Create a triple Quantum well.

We create a wierd situation where ground state for the hole is higher than the electrons whcih is siting in the GaSb

Band inversion- is the name for this situation. 

this creates a chiral state where in order to scatter, it need to have a state to scatter into but this chirality makes that not very easy to comeby. 

we are going to grow this band inverted wells.

First we replicate the germanes work 001 GaSb
and then do our patentented 111 GaSb 

500 nm GaSb takes 3 hours on 111

anytime we use aluminum we always cap it because it oxides extremely fast
