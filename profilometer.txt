we like the bigger stylus for step resolution 12.5 micron

the do the tip changes and callibration

couple microns of photo resist range 6.5 micron this time

standard scam 

hills and valleets

correct styles is color coded

stylus force how hard you want to push down

we have to teeach the length of scan with the little wand

roulpghly 20 sec scan is pretty good for 200 micron scan

want to reduce the slope of the before the slope. the slope was postiive so we turn the nob counter clockwise

the software can fine tun the base if the knob os not accurate enough

measjememnt setup buttong top middle gets you where you are going

deleted something on "scan" and added terms removal post porcessing to level the data

right click the graph and get to data leveling sttings . two point linear fit is the one 

step hieght is down in watch list. we can screen shot at this stage

we used standard photoresist
 
right click the screen to align

for a 3d scan:
    gunna be a measurement instead ogf single aquisition
    standarts scan type to map scan type
    number of traces is number of scans
    flip sample 180 and do re null
when leveling you can level at a lowe resolution first

avoid dark edges

Need to make it such that we are averaging over 10 scans and it takes 5 mins. Might need to do 8 scans to achieve a 3 minute scan
pull up the data folder and copy each scans data to jays folder


sample 7:
    doing 10, 15 second scans
    6.5 resolution. Taking the middle of the sample everytime because the sample is ugly. this will minimize the weird y axix effects of the map scan.
    1. screen shot the beggening of the scan.
    2. Save the data file
    3 screen shot the avg higher data analysis
    4. screen shot map picture:
    This set up creates a clean 2 micron original step height!
