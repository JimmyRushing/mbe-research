we like the bigger stylus for step resolution 12.5 micron

the do the tip changes and callibration

couple microns of photo resist range 6.5 micron this time

standard scam 

hills and valleets

correct styles is color coded

stylus force how hard you want to push down

we have to teeach the length of scan with the little wand

roulpghly 20 sec scan is pretty good for 200 micron scan

want to reduce the slope of the before the slope. the slope was postiive so we turn the nob counter clockwise

the software can fine tun the base if the knob os not accurate enough

measjememnt setup buttong top middle gets you where you are going

deleted something on "scan" and added terms removal post porcessing to level the data

right click the graph and get to data leveling sttings . two point linear fit is the one 

step hieght is down in watch list. we can screen shot at this stage

we used standard photoresist
