We have 5 samples. We need to a first scan to set the original step height

load sample with low side facing the user( photoresist faceing away

Turn renulling on. 

use map scan 

take a picture of the beggining and ending points of the scan

do ten scans 

screen shot scan parameters

scanning as deep into the sample as possible so we dont get the edge effects so drastically. 

click save data set to your own directory for future analysis

for sample 5 im going deeoper into the photoresist in order to atone for the edge roughness

when calculating step hieght, make sure to increase curser hieght to get all scans

to get error bars for my droplet. lets do ten map scans of the same droplet and see what the difference is. I will do this on a dummy wafer

current plan is to put a droplet of photoresist on. use a chemwipe to absorb some the hight away from the dot. :wq

taking a picture to show which dot is which


M644 is etching down but not uniformly I saved the surface profile. It is exactly 325 nm deep pits

The InAlAs calibration sample has discernible dislocation lines. It will be interesting too see how that etches. At least I think that is what the pattern on the surface is
