15 MINUTE1etch 2,3,9 from sample 644 . 
etch sample 6 and 5 from m644 for 10 minutes

etching m620 for 3 minute then the middle samples for 2 minutes and the bottom row for 1 minutes

ph was 4.8........


found a tiny step . maybe a photo resist residue i am profiling it to see if there is any discernable change upon next etch. It was a nm step but the step was in the worng direction.

etching new batch of M644 InAlAs for sample 1 for 6 minutes, sample 2 for 4 sample 3 for 2 minutes

	Significant etching in the first 2 minutes

etching all InGaAs for 2 minutes and 10 seconds because i dropped the wafer more mminute   
The pH was 5.47 for this batch

M648 submerging the samples on the side with the double sample first. Doing one minute intervals

Ph was 5.5
