keep spin coat knob clean becuase its a vacuum

isoproplal, rinsing photorisitst can go down cup sink 

soft bake on the left

you have a day to expose the photo resist

update ssop for small piece recipe ECE540L-HMDS is for a 4 inch wafer

this might be why many of the photo resists are messeed up 

HDMS_Simmonds is the new recipe

you have to hit the vacuum button . it malfuntioned making a vacuum(perhaps the wafer is too small?)

3/4 inch square wafer is necessary for spinnig 

basic photo risist has the math for how long to expose the photo resist

photo resist was 2.5 micron, 3500 rpm for 30 seconds, exposure time was 18 seconds based on the ellipsometor and it took roupghly 45 seconds of developement time.

5 minute soft back to get the photoresist to stick to the wafer with photo reesist.`

lamp power and and lamp ignotor on ellipsometor to turn on then software is complete ease"

new recipe is about 3.3 microns of photoresists. which equates to 320 dosage. 21 seconds
could have done 22 or 23 seconds as all the resist didnt come off. we developed the photo resist for 30 seconds. 

developer can go right back into the container for recycling

MARCH 29 NOTEs

Baking a small silicon pice onto a 1/4 2 inch wafer to test everything

Baking at 115 for 2 mins adhere a small wafer to the above one

Baking hdms for 60 seconds on small wafer

Baking the actual photoresist layer for 3 minutes so that the heat can get all the way through

For the mask aligner: in option 2 select pressure contact in option three we need option 1 and 2 (exposure pressure constant exp pressure

Power-on requires on switch and then hold start until the gauge flips

I did a 26 second exposure to cook that beast. YOU MUST BLOCK THE LIGHT UNDERNEATH THE GLASS THING WHICH IS WHY SOME LIGHT WAS GETTING INTO THE OTHER ONES. 

NEED TO HARD BAKE AFTER UV CURING THE PHOTORESIST. I AM DOING 90 SECONDS BECUASE OF THE TWO LAYERS.

THE "check list " has more information that the SOP yuck.

2 minute soft bake on wafer gluing process


90 seconds soft bake on HMDS step 

2 min soft bake main phot resist

Do not leave HMDS on for any excess time, can get under the wafer, do not glob on too much either 

Changing to 90 then 60 then 90 for soft bakes (THIS SEEMED TO HAVE WORKED IM USING THIN 2 INCH SILICON WAFERS SO I DONT NEED TO CRANK THE HEAT AS MUCH AS BEFORE. 

For the glue stage spin slow so you have a thicker glue 

The glob of HMDS matters a lot, if it goes past the edges of the sample, it will jump 

For the glue layer I started the spin process for HDMS and killed it as soon as the blob spread out. Just want a thick layer of glue

The wafers kept jumping off. I found that  the above sentence plus pushing on the upper wafer with the smooth side of tweezers to glue down well plus making sure we are for real centered keeps them from jumping out. 


For m620 
Exposing for 20 seconds 

It like either all the photo resist comes off or none comes off. Don't know what the fuck is going on
M631 #2 and 3 have been exposed but not hard baked or developed
M631 #1 has been hard baked developed along with m620 #2 but I have no idea if it worked
M620 #1 AND M631 #4 out of commission 
Samples that not all the photo resist came off: m631#1 

Don't etch the ones with tape


Marking the beginning of the line with a blank, moving in clock wise rotation

Capton tape 

Need ziplock bags

Another abject failure
The masking doesn't work. The developer doesn't work. The spin coater doesn't work. 

Place dot of photo resist absorb some. Plop sample in let gravity slide it around for a nice coating on the back . Bake at 125 for 2 minutes

Place dot of photoresist on sample and absorb a lot
Bake for 300 seconds

Fold a chemwipe up to hold. Samples . Going from hot to cold metal can fuck up the photoresist

put all small guys on one 2 inch wafer . labelled with photo restis. the 2 above the line a m620 and the three below are m640 (04-19-2023). the one with no line is inalas m644. two minute soft bake 115. let rest (not on cold surface) while the block is heating to 150. then hard bake ffor 2 minutes. I can make these dots smaller. 

remove inAlAs 7 8 1 4 

softbaked on large wafer for 60. hard baked for 30 at 150 indivudually and then mounted and then super soft bake at 100 for 30

05-26-23
Accidentally mounted before hard baking.going to soft bake ofor 10 minutes instead. Going to hard back after and if I see any evidence of bubbling I'm taking it off. Did hard bake for 25 at 135. This seems to work well. Just have to make sure you slide samples around so there isn't too much resist under samples and or bubbles under samples.
